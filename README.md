## Attribute Queries
You may also query certain attributes by using the following syntax in your GET requests:
| Parameter | DataType | Returns |
| ------ | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Name | String | All names matching the input string |
| Species | String | All species matching the input string |
| SubSpecies | String | All SubSpecies of the parent species (eg, german shepherd) |
| Age | Integer | All animals at least [input value] years old |

    
## Examples
  * The following query will return all animals named "Kvothe":
      ```
      GET http://localhost:5001/api/animals?name=Kvothe
      ```
      Partial name matching is allowed (eg, querying 'sa' would return Sam, Lisa, etc )

  * The following query will return all animals at least 3 years old:
      ```
      GET http://localhost:5001/api/Location?minimumAge=3
      ```
  * You can query multiple fields by concatening requests with &, like this:
      ```
      GET http://localhost:5001/api/Location?species=Cat&minimumAge=3
      ```
  * You may query specific entry IDs by appending it to the end:
      ```
      GET https://localhost:5001/api/Animals/4
      ```

  * A body is required for POST requests. Example of a good request would be:
      ```
      { 
        "name": "Bongo Jones",
        "species": "Cat",
        "subSpecies": "Tabby",
        "age": 3,
      }
      ```
  * An ID is required for PUT requests (modifying an existing entry) including the ID of the entry:
      ```
      {
        "animalId": 1,
        "name": "Kvothe",
        "species": "Cat",
        "subSpecies": "Himalayan",
        "age": 10,
      }
      ```
